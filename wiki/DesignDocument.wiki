= Project Objectives =

Provide an open source library to assist Python developers in using Google GData APIs. A secondary objective is to provide code for Atom and the Atom Publishing Protocol. This client library will form the foundation for the GData Python sample code.

== Supported Properties ==

The following GData web services are supported in this client library:
   * Google Base Data API
   * Google Calendar Data API

= Overview = 

The client library contains two broad categories of classes: data models and service clients.

The service classes will provide methods to perform CRUD operations and queries on Google web services. They will also contain a class for carrying operations in the Atom Publishing Protocol.

The data model classes simplify the construction and manipulation of XML for the resources accessed through the web services.
