=How to become a contributor and submit patches=

We'd love to accept your code patches! However, before we can take them, we have to jump through a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement found below:

http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html

http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html

Once you have filled that out, please either fax it or send it via snail mail to us. Once we receive it, we'll add you to the official list of contributors and be able to accept your packages.
