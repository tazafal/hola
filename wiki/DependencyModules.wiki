= Introduction =

The modules in the project depend on the following modules. If they are not present in your execution environment, they will need to be added.

===Element Tree===

Element Tree is a module for XML parsing and processing. Instructions for downloading and configuring this module can be found here: http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm

===httplib===

httplib has been part of the core Python library since version 2.0, so it should already be present on your system.

===urllib===

urllib is also a core Python library, so you should not have to install it.
