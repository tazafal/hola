= Overview =

Releasing a new download requires a few steps to be performed. For each release, the changes are listed in the release notes, pydocs are updated to reflect changes in the code, and the library source code, tests, etc. are packaged up in tar.gz files and .zip archives. The archives are then added to the Downloads section of this project. See detailed step by step instructions below.

= Steps =

  # Write release notes (RELEASE_NOTES.txt) for the new release.
  # Update the version number in setup.py and in the user agent header in {{{__SetSource}}} in {{{src/gdata/service.py}}}.
