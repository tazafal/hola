#summary Steps to create a new release package.
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Overview =

Releasing a new download requires a few steps to be performed. For each release, the changes are listed in the release notes, pydocs are updated to reflect changes in the code, and the library source code, tests, etc. are packaged up in tar.gz files and .zip archives. The archives are then added to the Downloads section of this project. See detailed step by step instructions below.

= Steps =

  # Write release notes ({{{RELEASE_NOTES.txt}}}) for the new release.
  # Update the version number in {{{setup.py}}} and in the user agent header in {{{__SetSource}}} in {{{src/gdata/service.py}}}.
  # Regenerate the pydoc documentation pages.
    # if any new files have been added in this release, list them in the pydoc shell script: {{{pydocs/generate_docs}}}
    # run the {{{pydocs/generate_docs}}} script
  # Add new packages and files to the indexes so that they will be include in the archives and installed.
    # edit the {{{MANIFEST}}} file, which lists all of the files which should be included in the .zip and .tzr.gz archives
    # edit the list of packages in {{{setup.py}}}. This list determines which packages will be compiled and installed on the user's system.
  # Generate the download archives
    # run {{{python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip}}} which will create {{{gdata.py-<version.number>.zip}}} and {{{.tar.gz}}} files in the {{{dist}}} directory.
    # upload the archives to the project's downloads page.
